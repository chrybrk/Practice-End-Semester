## Commnication Barries

### Cycle
* **Sender:** The sender initiates a conversation, encodes the message, and moves it forward via an appropriate channel.
* **Message:** In this stage, the sender selects a suitable channel to package the message and convey it.
* **Medium for the message:** The medium that exists between the sender and the receiver affects the communication.
* **Noise:** Language barriers, as well as other conventions such as tradition or culture, might become inflexible in the sender's communication process. These barriers can result in an incomplete communication cycle and improper encoding and decoding.
* **Receiver:** The receiver receives the package and decodes the package.
* **Feedback:** Feedback is needed to complete the cycle. The decoded message from the receiver is validated and the resultant feedback is sent back to the sender.

### Flow of Commnication
* **Downward Communication:** When leaders and managers share information with lower-level employees, it’s called downward, or top-down communication.
* **Upward Communication:** Upward communication is the transmission of information from lower levels of an organization to higher ones; the most common situation is employees communicating with managers.
* **Horizontal Communication:** Horizontal communication, also called lateral communication, involves the flow of messages between individuals and groups on the same level of an organization, as opposed to up or down.
* **Diagonal Communication:** Diagonal communication is the sharing of information among different structural levels within a business.

* **Lack of attention:** If one person is not paying attention, they may miss important information or fail to understand the message.
* **Inadequate feedback:** If feedback is not given or received properly, it can lead to misunderstandings or confusion.
* **Technology barriers:** Technology can sometimes malfunction, or individuals may lack the necessary technological skills to communicate effectively.
