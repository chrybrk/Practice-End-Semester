# Question Bank

# Question 1 -> Discuss the Encapsulation and Access specifiers in C#.

# Encapsulation and Access Specifiers in C#

Encapsulation in C# involves bundling data and methods within a class and controlling access to them. Access specifiers determine the visibility of members within a class and from external code.

## Access Specifiers:

1. **Public**: Accessible from any class or assembly.
2. **Private**: Accessible only within the same class or struct.
3. **Protected**: Accessible within the same class or from derived classes.
4. **Internal**: Accessible within the same assembly but not outside.
5. **Protected Internal**: Accessible within the same assembly or from derived classes.

## Encapsulation:

- **Data Protection**: By using private members, data integrity is maintained as they cannot be accessed from outside the class.
- **Controlled Access**: Public methods provide a controlled interface for interacting with encapsulated data, preventing unintended modifications.
- **Abstraction**: Encapsulation hides the complex internal workings of a class, allowing users to interact with it at a higher level without needing to know its implementation details.

Encapsulation, combined with access specifiers, enhances code readability, maintainability, and security by restricting access to internal components and providing a clear interface for interaction.

# Question 2 -> Describe the code for delete a folder in C#.

# Deleting a Folder in C#

To delete a folder in C#, you can use the `Directory.Delete()` method provided by the `System.IO` namespace. This method deletes the specified directory and, if indicated, any subdirectories and files in the directory.

## Code Example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string folderPath = @"C:\Path\To\Folder";

        try
        {
            // Delete the folder and its contents recursively
            Directory.Delete(folderPath, true);
            Console.WriteLine("Folder deleted successfully.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

# Question 3 -> What is the output of below program?

```csharp
private static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
    int a = 10, b = 20;
    Console.WriteLine("Before Swappping a=" + a + " b=" + b);
    a = a + b; //Here a=30 (10+20=30)      
    b = a - b; //Here b=10 (30-20=10)      
    a = a - b; //Here a=20 (30-10=20)   
    Console.Write("After Swaping a=" + a + " b=" + b);
    Console.ReadLine();
}

Before Swapping a=10 b=20
After Swapping a=20 b=10

```

# Question 4 -> Explain the different types of inheritance available in C# language with the help of an example.

# Types of Inheritance in C#

Inheritance in C# allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behavior from another class (base class or superclass). C# supports the following types of inheritance:

## 1. Single Inheritance
## 2. Multilevel Inheritance
## 3. Hierarchical Inheritance

### Example:

```csharp
class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking.");
    }
}
```

# Question 5 -> Outline the FlagsAttribute and ObsoleteAttribute with 2 differences.

# FlagsAttribute vs. ObsoleteAttribute

# Querying 11 -> Explain working of garbage collection in ASP.NET?

# Garbage Collection in ASP.NET

Garbage collection (GC) in ASP.NET is a process by which the .NET runtime automatically manages memory and deallocates objects that are no longer in use, thereby reclaiming memory resources and preventing memory leaks.

## Working Process:

1. **Memory Allocation**: When an ASP.NET application is executed, memory is allocated to store objects and data structures created during program execution, including objects representing web pages, controls, sessions, and application state.
2. **Object Lifetimes**: Each object allocated in memory is assigned a lifetime based on its usage and references. Objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the application become eligible for garbage collection.
3. **GC Triggers**: The .NET runtime periodically checks the heap for unreferenced objects and triggers garbage collection when certain conditions are met, such as when memory pressure reaches a certain threshold or when the application is under low CPU utilization.
4. **Mark and Sweep**: During garbage collection, the runtime performs a mark-and-sweep algorithm to identify and reclaim memory occupied by unreferenced objects. It traverses the object graph starting from root objects (e.g., global variables, thread stacks) and marks all reachable objects. Unmarked objects are considered garbage and are deallocated from memory.
5. **Finalization**: Before deallocating objects, the runtime invokes finalizers (destructors) of objects that have them defined. Finalizers allow objects to release unmanaged resources before they are destroyed.
6. **Memory Reclamation**: After marking and finalization, the runtime deallocates memory occupied by garbage objects and compacts the heap to reduce fragmentation, ensuring efficient memory usage.

## Benefits:

- **Automatic Memory Management**: Garbage collection relieves developers from manually managing memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks and resource exhaustion.
- **Improved Application Stability**: By reclaiming unused memory resources, garbage collection helps prevent out-of-memory exceptions and improves the stability and performance of ASP.NET applications.
- **Simplified Development**: Developers can focus on application logic and functionality without worrying about memory management, leading to faster development cycles and easier maintenance.

Garbage collection plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient memory utilization and stability in ASP.NET applications, allowing developers to build robust and scalable web applications without the burden of manual memory management.

# Question 12 -> Define the objective for “File I/O” using C#.

# Objective for File I/O in C#

The objective of "File I/O" (Input/Output) using C# is to provide developers with the capability to read from and write to files on the file system. File I/O operations allow applications to interact with external files, such as text files, binary files, configuration files, and more, facilitating tasks like data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Reading from Files**: Enable reading data from existing files, including text, binary, or XML files, into memory for processing by the application.
2. **Writing to Files**: Support writing data generated by the application, such as logs, reports, or user-generated content, to files on the file system.
3. **File Manipulation**: Provide functionality for creating, deleting, moving, copying, and renaming files and directories as needed by the application.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions that may occur during file I/O operations, ensuring application stability and reliability.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize file I/O operations for performance and efficiency, considering factors such as buffering, asynchronous I/O, and file system caching to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

By achieving these objectives, File I/O in C# empowers developers to seamlessly integrate file management capabilities into their applications, enabling data persistence, configuration management, logging, and other essential functionalities.

# Question 13 -> Describe the objective of MSIL in .net framework.

# Objective of MSIL in .NET Framework

The objective of MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) in the .NET Framework is to provide a platform-independent, intermediate representation of .NET code that can be executed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR). MSIL serves as an intermediary step between source code written in high-level languages (such as C#, Visual Basic.NET, or F#) and native machine code executed by the underlying hardware.

## Key Objectives:

1. **Platform Independence**: MSIL allows .NET code to be compiled into a platform-independent format, enabling it to run on any system that has the .NET runtime installed, regardless of the underlying hardware architecture or operating system.
2. **Interoperability**: By providing a common intermediate language, MSIL promotes interoperability between different .NET languages, allowing components written in one language to seamlessly interact with components written in another language within the same application.
3. **Optimization Opportunities**: MSIL provides opportunities for runtime optimizations by allowing the CLR to perform just-in-time (JIT) compilation and optimization of code based on the execution environment, hardware capabilities, and usage patterns.
4. **Security**: MSIL includes built-in security features such as code access security and verifiability, which help ensure the safety and integrity of .NET code running within the CLR environment.
5. **Debugging and Diagnostics**: MSIL retains debugging information from the original source code, allowing developers to debug and diagnose issues in their applications using tools like Visual Studio and the CLR Debugger.
6. **Versioning and Deployment**: MSIL simplifies versioning and deployment of .NET applications by decoupling the compiled code from the underlying hardware and operating system, making it easier to distribute and update applications across different environments.

By achieving these objectives, MSIL plays a crucial role in the .NET development ecosystem, providing a common language runtime environment that enables cross-platform compatibility, language interoperability, runtime optimization, security, and ease of development and deployment.

# Question 14 -> Discuss the method overriding with example.

# Method Overriding in C#

Method overriding in C# is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. It enables polymorphism, where a method call on a base class reference can invoke different implementations based on the actual derived class type.

## Key Concepts:

- **Base Class and Derived Class**: Method overriding occurs in the context of inheritance, where a derived class (subclass) inherits methods from its base class (superclass).
- **Virtual Methods**: In order to allow method overriding, the base class method must be declared as `virtual`. This indicates to the compiler that derived classes are allowed to override the method.
- **Override Modifier**: In the derived class, the method that overrides the base class method must be explicitly marked with the `override` modifier.
- **Dynamic Dispatch**: The method implementation to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object, allowing for polymorphic behavior.

## Example:

```csharp
using System;

class Shape
{
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Shape shape1 = new Circle();
        Shape shape2 = new Rectangle();

        shape1.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle.
        shape2.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle.
    }
}
```

# Question 15 -> Illustrate the purpose of the finally block in C#.

# Purpose of the `finally` Block in C#
The `finally` block in C# is used in exception handling to ensure that certain code executes regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is typically used to perform cleanup tasks, such as releasing resources, closing files, or closing database connections, to ensure that resources are properly managed and deallocated.

## Key Concepts:
- **Execution Guarantee**: Code inside the `finally` block is guaranteed to execute, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught in the `try` block.
- **Resource Cleanup**: The `finally` block is commonly used to release resources acquired in the `try` block, ensuring that resources are properly managed and not leaked.
- **Exception Propagation**: If an exception is thrown in the `finally` block itself, it will propagate up the call stack, overriding any previously caught exceptions from the `try` block.

## Example:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            // Open a file or acquire a resource
            Console.WriteLine("Opening file or acquiring resource.");
            
            // Simulate an exception
            throw new Exception("Simulated exception");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Exception caught: " + ex.Message);
        }
        finally
        {
            // Release the resource or perform cleanup
            Console.WriteLine("Closing file or releasing resource.");
        }
    }
}
```

# Question 16 -> What is delegate in C# discuss?

# Delegates in C#

A delegate in C# is a type that represents a reference to a method. It allows methods to be passed as parameters, stored in variables, and invoked dynamically. Delegates facilitate the implementation of callback mechanisms, event handling, and other scenarios where method references need to be passed around and invoked at runtime.

## Key Concepts:

- **Type Safety**: Delegates are type-safe function pointers, ensuring that method signatures match the delegate's signature at compile time.
- **Delegate Declaration**: Delegates are declared using the `delegate` keyword, specifying the return type and parameters of the delegate method.
- **Delegate Instances**: Delegate instances are created by associating them with methods that have compatible signatures. This can be done using method references, lambda expressions, or anonymous methods.
- **Invocation**: Delegate instances can be invoked just like regular methods, triggering the execution of the underlying method(s) they reference.
- **Multicast Delegates**: Delegates can reference multiple methods, allowing them to invoke multiple methods sequentially or concurrently. Multicast delegates are implemented using the `+=` and `-=` operators to add or remove method references.

## Example:

```csharp
using System;

// Declare a delegate type
delegate void MathOperation(int x, int y);

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Associate the delegate with a method using method references
        MathOperation add = Add;
        MathOperation subtract = Subtract;

        // Invoke the delegate instances
        add(5, 3); // Output: 5 + 3 = 8
        subtract(5, 3); // Output: 5 - 3 = 2

        // Associate the delegate with lambda expressions
        MathOperation multiply = (x, y) => Console.WriteLine($"{x} * {y} = {x * y}");

        // Invoke the delegate instance
        multiply(5, 3); // Output: 5 * 3 = 15
    }

    // Methods to be associated with the delegate
    static void Add(int x, int y)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{x} + {y} = {x + y}");
    }

    static void Subtract(int x, int y)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{x} - {y} = {x - y}");
    }
}
```

- **Version**: The version number of the assembly, indicating the version of the assembly's code and resources.
- **Culture**: The culture or language associated with the assembly, specifying localization or globalization settings.
- **Public Key Token**: A cryptographic hash of the assembly's public key, used to ensure assembly integrity and prevent tampering.
- **Other Attributes**: Additional attributes such as processor architecture and custom attributes may also be included in the AssemblyName.

## Usage in Reflection:
- **Assembly Loading**: AssemblyName is used to load assemblies dynamically at runtime using reflection APIs such as `Assembly.Load` or `Assembly.LoadFrom`.
- **Assembly Identification**: AssemblyName is used to uniquely identify assemblies when inspecting types and members using reflection.
- **Assembly Versioning**: AssemblyName provides information about the version of the assembly, which can be used for version-specific behaviors or compatibility checks.
- **Strong Naming**: AssemblyName includes the public key token, which is used in strong naming to ensure assembly integrity and prevent assembly spoofing or tampering.

By providing metadata about assemblies, AssemblyName enables dynamic discovery and interaction with types and members within assemblies at runtime, facilitating various runtime reflection operations in .NET applications.

# Question 19 -> Explain the concept of multi-threading in c#.

# Multi-Threading in C#
Multi-threading in C# refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently, allowing different parts of the code to run concurrently and independently of each other. Threads are lightweight processes within an application that can perform tasks asynchronously, improving responsiveness, performance, and resource utilization.

## Key Concepts:
- **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a program. It represents a sequential flow of control within the application and can execute code independently of other threads.
- **Concurrency**: Multi-threading enables concurrent execution of multiple threads within the same application, allowing tasks to overlap and execute simultaneously.
- **Parallelism**: Parallelism refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple threads on multiple processors or processor cores, increasing overall throughput and performance.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Since threads may access shared resources concurrently, thread synchronization mechanisms such as locks, mutexes, semaphores, and monitors are used to coordinate access and prevent race conditions and data corruption.
- **Thread Safety**: Thread-safe code ensures that shared resources are accessed in a thread-safe manner, preventing data corruption and maintaining program correctness in multi-threaded environments.

## Benefits:
- **Improved Responsiveness**: Multi-threading allows applications to remain responsive while performing time-consuming tasks in the background, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Increased Performance**: Parallel execution of tasks can leverage the processing power of multiple cores, leading to faster execution and improved throughput.
- **Resource Utilization**: Multi-threading maximizes CPU and I/O device utilization by allowing tasks to run concurrently, efficiently utilizing system resources.
- **Scalability**: Multi-threaded applications can scale to handle increased workloads by distributing tasks across multiple threads, accommodating more users and processing more requests simultaneously.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Multi-threading enables asynchronous programming models, where tasks can execute asynchronously without blocking the main thread, improving application responsiveness and scalability.

Multi-threading is a powerful feature of C# that enables developers to write concurrent, scalable, and responsive applications by leveraging the parallel execution of multiple threads.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create and start two threads
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(CountNumbers);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(CountNumbers);

        thread1.Start(); // Start the first thread
        thread2.Start(); // Start the second thread

        // Wait for both threads to complete
        thread1.Join();
        thread2.Join();

        Console.WriteLine("Main thread exiting.");
    }

    static void CountNumbers()
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}: Counting {i}");
            Thread.Sleep(100); // Simulate some work
        }
    }
}
```

# Question 20 -> Discuss the “Directory.Delete” method in C#.

# Directory.Delete Method in C#
The `Directory.Delete` method in C# is used to delete a directory and, optionally, its contents. It allows developers to remove directories from the file system programmatically, providing flexibility and control over directory management tasks.

## Key Points:
- **Directory Deletion**: The `Directory.Delete` method deletes the specified directory if it exists, along with all its subdirectories and files, unless specified otherwise.
- **Recursive Deletion**: By default, the method performs a recursive deletion, removing the directory and all its contents recursively. This behavior can be modified using the `recursive` parameter.
- **Exception Handling**: If the directory does not exist, an exception of type `DirectoryNotFoundException` is thrown. Additionally, if the directory cannot be deleted due to permission issues or if it contains read-only files, an `UnauthorizedAccessException` or `IOException` may be thrown.
- **Optional Parameters**: The method overloads allow developers to specify whether to delete the directory recursively, whether to ignore any errors encountered during deletion, and whether to delete only the directory's contents without removing the directory itself.

## Example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string directoryPath = @"C:\ExampleDirectory";

        try
        {
            if (Directory.Exists(directoryPath))
            {
                Directory.Delete(directoryPath, recursive: true);
                Console.WriteLine("Directory deleted successfully.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Directory does not exist.");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error deleting directory: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

    }
}
```

# Question 22 -> Discuss versioning. How we can solve “DLL Hell” problem in asp.net?

# Versioning and Solving the "DLL Hell" Problem in ASP.NET

## Versioning:
Versioning is the practice of assigning unique identifiers (versions) to software components such as libraries, assemblies, or modules. It allows developers to track changes, manage dependencies, and ensure compatibility between different versions of software components.

## DLL Hell Problem:
The "DLL Hell" problem refers to issues that arise when multiple applications or components on a system depend on different versions of the same dynamic-link library (DLL). Common scenarios include:

- Conflicting versions of DLLs installed in the global assembly cache (GAC).
- Incompatibilities between DLL versions due to changes in APIs or behaviors.
- Difficulty in managing dependencies and resolving conflicts between different versions of DLLs.

## Solving DLL Hell in ASP.NET:
1. **Use Strong Naming**: Strong naming involves signing assemblies with a unique cryptographic key, resulting in a globally unique identity for each assembly. This helps prevent conflicts between different versions of the same assembly.
2. **Versioning Policies**: Define versioning policies for your applications and libraries, specifying how different versions of dependencies should be managed and resolved. This can include rules for assembly binding redirects, version ranges, or specific version requirements.
3. **Assembly Binding Redirects**: ASP.NET allows you to specify assembly binding redirects in configuration files (such as web.config), redirecting requests for specific versions of assemblies to a different version. This enables seamless compatibility between different versions of dependencies.
4. **Use NuGet Packages**: NuGet packages provide a standardized way to package and distribute libraries, including versioning information and dependency management. By using NuGet packages, you can easily manage dependencies and ensure consistent versions across projects.
5. **Side-by-Side Execution**: ASP.NET supports side-by-side execution of different versions of assemblies within the same application domain. This allows multiple versions of DLLs to coexist peacefully without interfering with each other.
6. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD practices to automate the build, test, and deployment process. This ensures that changes to dependencies are managed consistently and that conflicts or compatibility issues are detected early in the development lifecycle.

By following these versioning best practices and utilizing ASP.NET features such as strong naming, assembly binding redirects, and NuGet packages, you can effectively manage dependencies and avoid the "DLL Hell" problem in your ASP.NET applications.

# Question 23 -> Illustrate the implicit conversion in C#? Explain with the help of an example.

# Implicit Conversion in C#
Implicit conversion in C# refers to the automatic conversion of one data type to another by the compiler when it is safe and lossless to do so. It allows the assignment of a value of one data type to a variable of another data type without requiring an explicit cast.

## Example:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int intValue = 10;
        double doubleValue;

        // Implicit conversion from int to double
        doubleValue = intValue;

        Console.WriteLine($"intValue: {intValue}");
        Console.WriteLine($"doubleValue: {doubleValue}");
    }
}
```

# Question 24 -> Classify the Status Bar also write it’s syntax.

# StatusBar Control in C#
The StatusBar control in C# is a user interface (UI) control used to display status information to the user. It is commonly found at the bottom of a window or form and provides feedback on the current state of the application, such as status messages, progress indicators, or contextual information.

## Syntax:

```csharp
// Create a new instance of StatusBar
StatusBar statusBar1 = new StatusBar();

// Set properties of the StatusBar control
statusBar1.Text = "Ready"; // Set the default status text
statusBar1.ShowPanels = true; // Enable panel display

// Add panels to the StatusBar control
StatusBarPanel panel1 = new StatusBarPanel();
panel1.Text = "Panel 1";
statusBar1.Panels.Add(panel1);

StatusBarPanel panel2 = new StatusBarPanel();
panel2.Text = "Panel 2";
statusBar1.Panels.Add(panel2);

// Set panel widths
statusBar1.Panels[0].Width = 100; // Set width of Panel 1
statusBar1.Panels[1].Width = 200; // Set width of Panel 2

// Add StatusBar control to the form
this.Controls.Add(statusBar1);
```

# Question 25 -> Demonstrate the differences between private and shared assemblies.

# Differences Between Private and Shared Assemblies in C#

## Private Assemblies:
- **Scope**: Private assemblies are specific to a single application and are stored in the application's directory or subdirectories.
- **Visibility**: Private assemblies are accessible only to the application that contains them. They cannot be accessed by other applications.
- **Deployment**: Private assemblies are deployed with the application and are typically copied to the application's installation directory during deployment.
- **Versioning**: Each application can have its own copy of a private assembly with a different version, allowing applications to use different versions of the same assembly simultaneously without conflicts.

## Shared Assemblies:
- **Scope**: Shared assemblies are designed to be shared among multiple applications and can be installed in a global location such as the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).
- **Visibility**: Shared assemblies are accessible to any application on the system that references them. They can be accessed by multiple applications simultaneously.
- **Deployment**: Shared assemblies are not deployed with individual applications. Instead, they are installed in a common location such as the GAC during deployment or by using installation packages.
- **Versioning**: Shared assemblies must have a unique identity, including a strong name, to prevent conflicts when multiple versions of the same assembly are installed in the GAC. Versioning and compatibility must be carefully managed to avoid conflicts.

## Example:
- **Private Assembly**: A utility library specific to an application, such as logging functionality, is packaged as a private assembly and deployed with the application.
- **Shared Assembly**: A common library used by multiple applications across the organization, such as a set of reusable UI controls, is packaged as a shared assembly and installed in the GAC for shared access.

By understanding the differences between private and shared assemblies, developers can choose the appropriate deployment strategy based on the scope and visibility requirements of their applications and components.

# Question 26 -> Explain the differences between abstraction and encapsulation in C# with example.

# Differences Between Abstraction and Encapsulation in C#

## Abstraction:
- **Definition**: Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object or system.
- **Focus**: Abstraction focuses on defining a clear and concise interface for interacting with objects, hiding unnecessary details and complexity from users.
- **Example**: In C#, an abstract class or interface defines an abstraction by specifying a contract that derived classes or implementations must follow. Abstract methods or properties define the interface, while concrete subclasses provide the implementation.

```csharp
// Example of abstraction using an abstract class
public abstract class Shape
{
    // Abstract method to calculate area
    public abstract double CalculateArea();
}

// Concrete subclass implementing the abstract class
public class Circle : Shape
{
    private double radius;

    // Constructor
    public Circle(double radius)
    {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    // Implementation of abstract method
    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```
## Encapsulation:

- **Definition:** Encapsulation is the bundling of data (fields) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.
- **Focus:** Encapsulation focuses on hiding internal state and implementation details of an object, allowing access to data only through well-defined interfaces (properties and methods).
- **Example:** In C#, private fields and properties are used to encapsulate data, while public methods provide controlled access to manipulate the data. Encapsulation ensures data integrity and promotes code maintainability and reusability.

```csharp
// Example of encapsulation using a class
public class Person
{
    // Private fields
    private string name;
    private int age;

    // Public properties
    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }

    public int Age
    {
        get { return age; }
        set { age = value; }
    }

    // Constructor
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Public method
    public void DisplayInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}, Age: {Age}");
    }
}
```

# Question 27 -> Build a C# program to print even numbers from 1 to N. And N = 30.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int N = 30;

        Console.WriteLine("Even numbers from 1 to " + N + ":");

        for (int i = 2; i <= N; i += 2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i);
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
private static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int i, sum = 0, n;
            Console.Write("Enter the Nth Number : ");
            n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
            for (i = 0; i <= n; i++)
            {
                sum = sum + i;
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Sum of N Numbers : " + sum);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }

```
# Question 28 -> N=50 find the error above program, if none write the output.

```
Enter the Nth Number : 50

```

# Question 29 -> What is an event handler? How is it designed? Examine with the help of an example.

# Event Handler in C#
An event handler in C# is a method that handles events raised by objects. It is responsible for responding to an event when it occurs, executing specific actions or logic in response to the event.

## Design of Event Handler:
- **Declaration**: An event handler is declared with a signature that matches the delegate type of the event it handles.
- **Registration**: The event handler is registered with an event by adding it to the event's invocation list using the `+=` operator.
- **Implementation**: The event handler implements the desired functionality or behavior that should occur in response to the event.

## Example:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Define an event
        EventHandler buttonClickEvent;

        // Create an instance of the event publisher (e.g., a button)
        Button button = new Button();

        // Register an event handler with the event
        buttonClickEvent += OnButtonClick;

        // Simulate a button click (raise the event)
        button.Click();

        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    // Event handler method
    static void OnButtonClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Button clicked!");
    }
}

// Example class representing a Button control
class Button
{
    // Event declaration
    public event EventHandler Click;

    // Method to simulate a button click
    public void Click()
    {
        // Raise the Click event
        OnClick(EventArgs.Empty);
    }

    // Method to raise the Click event
    protected virtual void OnClick(EventArgs e)
    {
        // Check if any event handlers are registered
        Click?.Invoke(this, e);
    }
}
```

# Question 30 -> Examine the life cycle of Threading in C#. Also explain the all the threads State in C# application.

# Threading Life Cycle and Thread States in C#

## Threading Life Cycle:
1. **Thread Creation**: A thread is created either by instantiating the `Thread` class or by using higher-level constructs such as tasks or thread pool.
2. **Thread Start**: The thread starts executing when its `Start` method is called. The thread transitions from the `Unstarted` state to the `Running` state.
3. **Thread Execution**: The thread executes the code specified in its entry point method until it completes its task or is explicitly terminated.
4. **Thread Termination**: The thread terminates either when its entry point method completes execution or when it is explicitly terminated using the `Abort` method or by returning from the entry point method.

## Thread States in C# Application:
- **Unstarted**: The thread has been created but has not yet started. It is waiting for its `Start` method to be called.
- **Running**: The thread is actively executing its code. It is in a running state.
- **Stopped**: The thread has completed its task or has been terminated. It is no longer executing.
- **Suspended**: The thread has been temporarily suspended from execution. It is waiting to be resumed.
- **Sleeping**: The thread is in a sleeping or waiting state, typically due to a call to methods like `Thread.Sleep` or `Thread.Join`.
- **Blocked**: The thread is blocked, waiting for a resource or synchronization object such as a lock.
- **Aborted**: The thread has been aborted forcefully using the `Abort` method. It is in an aborted state and cannot be restarted.
- **Waiting**: The thread is waiting for a synchronization object, such as a mutex or semaphore, to become available.
- **Background**: The thread is a background thread, which does not prevent the application from terminating when all foreground threads have completed.
- **Foreground**: The thread is a foreground thread, which prevents the application from terminating until all foreground threads have completed.

Thread states in a C# application can change dynamically as threads are created, started, suspended, resumed, and terminated, depending on the execution flow of the program and the actions taken by the threads.

# Question 31 -> Conclude the followings:
1. Global ASAX Files
2. Web Configuration Files
3. Machine Configuration Files

| Configuration File Type    | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global ASAX Files           | Global.asax files contain application-level event handlers and global variables for ASP.NET applications. They are used to handle application-level events such as Application_Start, Application_End, Session_Start, and Session_End. |
| Web Configuration Files    | Web.config files are XML-based configuration files that define configuration settings for individual ASP.NET applications. They include settings such as connection strings, authentication modes, session state configuration, and custom application settings. |
| Machine Configuration Files | Machine.config files are XML-based configuration files that define configuration settings for all ASP.NET applications running on a specific machine. They provide default configuration settings for IIS and ASP.NET, including settings for ASP.NET runtime, security, globalization, and machine-wide application settings. |

# Distinguish between single file assembly and multifile assembly.  Write a program to implement single file assembly.

# Single-File Assembly vs Multi-File Assembly

## Single-File Assembly:

- **Definition**: A single-file assembly is a .NET assembly that contains all the compiled code and resources of a program in a single file.

- **Advantages**: Single-file assemblies are easy to distribute and deploy since they consist of a single file. They simplify versioning and deployment processes and are suitable for small to medium-sized applications.

- **Disadvantages**: Single-file assemblies may have larger file sizes compared to multi-file assemblies, especially for large applications with many dependencies.

## Multi-File Assembly:

- **Definition**: A multi-file assembly is a .NET assembly that consists of multiple files, each containing different parts of the assembly, such as modules, resources, or types.

- **Advantages**: Multi-file assemblies allow for better organization and management of large projects by splitting the code and resources into separate files. They can also reduce compilation times and improve build performance.

- **Disadvantages**: Multi-file assemblies may be more complex to manage and deploy compared to single-file assemblies. They require additional metadata and manifest files to link the individual files together.

## Implementing Single-File Assembly:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

# Question 32 -> Illustrate the syntax and usage of partial methods in ASP.NET.
## Provide examples demonstrating how to declare and implement partial methods in different parts of a class.

# Partial Methods in ASP.NET

Partial methods in ASP.NET allow you to split the definition of a method into two parts: a declaration part and an implementation part. The declaration part is defined in one part of a partial class, while the implementation part is defined in another part or generated by a code generator.

## Syntax:

```csharp
// Declaration part of partial method
partial void PartialMethod();

// Implementation part of partial method
partial void PartialMethod()
{
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```
##  Usage:

- Partial methods are typically used in scenarios where the implementation of a method may or may not be provided by the developer. Some common use cases include:
1. **Event notification**: Allow external code to subscribe to an event by providing an optional implementation.
2. **Code generation**: Enable code generators or tooling to generate method implementations based on specific conditions or requirements.

            graphics.Clear(Color.White);

            // Define the font and brush for drawing text
            Font font = new Font("Arial", 24, FontStyle.Bold);
            SolidBrush brush = new SolidBrush(Color.Blue);

            // Define the text to draw
            string text = "Hello, ASP.NET!";

            // Calculate the position to draw the text (centered)
            SizeF textSize = graphics.MeasureString(text, font);
            PointF textPosition = new PointF((bitmap.Width - textSize.Width) / 2, (bitmap.Height - textSize.Height) / 2);

            // Draw the text on the canvas
            graphics.DrawString(text, font, brush, textPosition);
        }

        // Output the bitmap as a PNG image
        Response.ContentType = "image/png";
        bitmap.Save(Response.OutputStream, ImageFormat.Png);

        // Dispose of the bitmap
        bitmap.Dispose();
    }
}
```
