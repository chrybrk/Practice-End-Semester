# > Revolt of 1857

## Immediate Factor

- The immediate factor was the **introduction of the ‘Enfield’ rifle.**
- The cartridge had to be **bitten off before** loading it into the gun.
- Indian sepoys believed that the cartridge was greased with either **pig fat or made from cow fat.**
- This was against the Hindu and Muslim sentiments. Thus they were reluctant to use the ‘Enfield’ rifle.
- This was a flashpoint to enrage the soldiers against the British.

## Cause

### Religious and Social Cause
1) Racism or racial discrimination was believed to be a major reason for the revolt of 1857
2) Wherein Indians were exploited and were kept away from mixing with Europeans
3) The whites also started interfering in the religious and cultural affairs of Indians and tortured them as well.

### Political Cause
1) Due to Britishers unjust policies the power of the Nawabs and Zamindars were lost.
2) Policy of Trade and Commerce.
3) Policy of indirect subordination. ( subsidiary alliance )
4) Policy of war and annexation.
5) Policy of direct subordination. ( **doctrine of lapse**, the doctrine of lapse was annexation policy followed by Dal housie, who was indian governer general from 1848 - 56.)
6) Policy of misgovernance.
7) These policies greatly hampered the interests of the rulers of the native states.

### Economic Factor
> Indians were affected by reforms in Economic by the British.

2) British Government had imposed and introduced various administrative policies to expand their territory.

### Military Factor
> They wanted new recruits for the Bengal Army, which affected their son from following or serving overseas.
1) Another major cause was the **General Enlistment Act of July 25 1856.**
2) The act required that new recruits to the Bengal Army to accept a commitment for general service.
3) Governor-General Lord Dalhousie felt it unfair that the burden of deployment fell squarely on the smaller presidency armies.
4) Sepoys of the Bengal Army felt that it would also prevent their sons from following their footsteps while fearing the prospect of serving overseas.

## Impact
- The major impact was the introduction of the Government of India Act.
- In **1858 which abolished** the rule of British East India Company.
- The beginning of British raj that bestowed powers in the hands of the British government to rule India directly through representatives.

## Causes of Failure of revolt of 1857.
- The sepoys lacked one clear leader; there were several. They also did not have a coherent plan by which the foreigners would be routed.
- Indian rulers who aided the revolt did not envision any plan for the country after the British were defeated.
- Majorly **northern India** was affected by this revolt.
- The three presidencies of **Bengal, Bombay and Madras** remained mostly unaffected.

# > Nationalism in India

## Rise of Nationalism
The Indian National Congress (INC) under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi brought all the different groups together under one movement. Although there were conflicts and disagreements between different groups about the path to be taken to attain freedom, all of them were driven by one single objective, i.e. independence.

Mahatma Gandhi led the Dandi March, Satyagraha, Civil Disobedience Movement, Non-cooperation Movement, and Quit India Movement against the British. All these led to the rise of nationalism among the Indians.

## Civil Disobedience Movement
On 31 January 1930, Mahatma Gandhi sent a letter to **Viceroy Irwin** stating and imposing **eleven demands**.
Among all the demands, the most stirring of all the demands was to abolish the **salt tax** that is consumed by the rich and the poor.

## Non-Cooperation Movement
1) The Non-Cooperation Movement was successfully launched by Mahatma Gandhi **on 31st August 1920.**
> In Non-Cooperation Movement middle-Class, tribals, workers and peasants participated to show nationalism.
2) The Non-Cooperation Movement was a truly national movement because this movement saw the participation of middle-Class, tribals, workers in plantations, and peasants in the countryside.
* Non-Cooperation was motivated by varied reasons.
    - Work for the eradication of untouchability from society.
    - Adopt swadeshi habits including hand spinning & weaving
    - Adopt swadeshi principles.
    - Foreign goods were boycotted and eliminated from the markets.
    - The council elections were boycotted in almost all provinces except Madras.

## Salt Satyagraha – Dandi March

2) The Salt Satyagraha march lasted for **24 days from 12th March 1930 to 5th April 1930.**
3) When Mahatma Gandhi was accompanied by 80 satyagrahis, all of whom were inmates of his ashram.
4) Civil Disobedience Movement was the first nationwide movement while all others were restricted to urban areas.
5) The participation of women was in large numbers.
6) Non-violence was the motto of this movement.

# Muslim League
> To create separate Muslim Nation during partition of British India (1947).
- Muslim League, original name All India Muslim League, political group that led the movement calling for a separate Muslim nation to be created at the time of the partition of British India (1947).
- The Muslim League was founded in 1906 to safeguard the rights of Indian Muslims.
- At first the league was encouraged by the British and was generally favourable to their rule, but the organization adopted self-government for India as its goal in 1913.
- For several decades the league and its leaders, notably Mohammed Ali Jinnah, called for Hindu-Muslim unity in a united and independent India.
- It was not until 1940 that the league called for the formation of a Muslim state that would be separate from the projected independent country of India.
- The league wanted a separate nation for India’s Muslims because it feared that an independent India would be dominated by Hindus.

# Hindu Mahasabha
Hindu Mahasabha was founded in 1915 to bring together the diverse local Hindu movements which had roots in North Indian public life, reaching back as far as the previous century.
It was remodelled much on the lines of the Congress in the early 1920s by its founders including UP's Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya.
With branches in most parts of India it put emphasis on social and religious work among Hindus and untouchables, on protection of cows and in the spread of Hindi.
The organisation remained more interested in protecting Hindu interests, particularly at times when the Congress tactics seemed to endanger them.

Since the mid 1920s, the Hindu Mahasabha's operations in Bengal remained mostly concentrated around the removal of untouchability and the purification of 'polluted' peoples.
The leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha with the support of local Congressmen undertook campaigns in favour of the social uplift of the untouchable communities.
The Mahasabha's involvement with the lower castes gained much prominence in the early 1930s, especially in the aftermath of Macdonald's Communal Award.
The Hindu Mahasabha invited aboriginals to adopt caste Hindu names and register their caste as ksatriya during the census enumeration. 
In Malda district, Mahasabha activists tried to persuade the aboriginal labourers and sharecroppers to stop work in the fields of Muslim jotedars.
They encouraged aboriginals to make a common cause with local Hindu politicians on the one hand and break their connections with the Muslim employers on the other.
They thought that such efforts would enable them to thwart the efforts of the leftists to win over the sharecroppers in the northern districts.
