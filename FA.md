- **IMPORTANT**: data retrieval and automation techniques for forensic examination with reference to presence of drugs ,glasses and adhesive at crime spot.

# Forensic Analysis : unit 1

## Intorduction
- Forensic Analysis is use to scintifically examine and evaluate the evidence for leagal purpose.

### Forensic Science Include
- Forensic Medicine
- Forensic Toxicology
- Forensic Odonotology
- Forensic Antrhopology
- Forensic Polic Science (criminology)
- Polygraphy and dna fingerprinting

### Principles of Forensic Science
1. Law Of Individuality: Every natural object has no duplicates, some properties may differ from one another.
2. Principle Of Exchange: In every action, some material gets exchanged.
3. Law Of Progressive Change: Everything change with relative to time.
4. Principle Of Comparison: Only the same matter can be compared.
5. Facts do not lie: We have to for a fact, when we are unaware of the truth.

### Forensic Science Lab
- It consist of tools and intstrument, and Scienctist to gather information.

# Real Case Analysis : unit 2

## Analysis Of Ethyl Alcohol

- Chemical: Kozelka & Hine method, Cavette method, Idoform test, wide mark method.
- Biochemical: ADH method
- Physical: GLC, Spectrophotometric analysis

1. Kozelka: Includes the distillation of alcohol under pressure. Potassium dichromate and disulpuric acid.

2. Idoform Test:
    - Take 1ml of distilled water drops of NaOH in it, this followed by a few dropwise addition till the solution become _brown_.
    - The mixture is boiled on spirit lamp for few minutes, KI solution is added in between.
    - _Yellow Precipitate_ is observed under microscope.

3. Widemark method:
    - [ a = cpr ]
    - a -> total amount of alcohol absorbed in body.
    - b -> weight of person
    - c -> conc. of alcohol in body.
    - r -> constant [ 0.68 for men ][ 0.5 for women ]
    - FOR URINE ANALYSIS:
    - [ a = 3/4 qpr ]
    - q -> conc. of alcohol in urine

4. ADH method:
    - Alcohol is oxidised by the enzyme ADH in the presence of co-enzymes.

## Trapcase Analysis

### Phenalphthalein powder
- Smooth white powder
- Applied on surface
- Washed with `Sodium Carbonate`, turns `pink`.

### Anthracene powder
- Florescence properties
- Under UV light
- Washed with Ethyl Alcohol

# Asphyxia and its causes
- Lack of oxygen in body.

## Classification

1. Mechanical: Outer force impact.
2. Non-mechanical: Different gas entered.
3. Laryngeal edema (pathological), high altitude.

## Weird causes
- Compression on neck
- Foreg: Hanging, Strangulation
- Fluid build-up in lungs. Drowninig
- Caused by exclusion of air from the lungs. Suffocation
- Caused by compression of chest.

1. Animal Poison
2. Plant poison
3. Volatile poison
4. Non-Volatile poison
5. Pesticides
6. Drugs

## Section of law
- Section 302 IPC punishment for murder
- Section 304 B IPC where the death of women is caused by any burn or bodly injury or occurs otherwise than under normal range within 7 years of her marrige and it is shown that soon.

## Type of poison

## Corrosive
- > Strong acid (HCL, CH3COOH, HCN)
- > Strong base (NaOH, Na2CO3)

## Irritant
- > Inorganic (Hgl, Pb), Non-Metallic (Cl-, CN-)
- > Organic (Animal: snake, Anything that can kill, Vegetables: dhatura)
- > Mechanical (Glass, Gas, Liquid)
- > Systmetic (Cordinal, Spinal, Cerebral, Asphyxia, Peripheral)
- > Some weird things (Volatile: Cloroform, Non-Volatile: Sleeping pills, pain killer, Toxic: CN-, Cl-, Pesticides: DDT)

## Question to ask
- Medical history
- Medicine he took
- When they noticed?
- Any exposure to foreign things?
